The dataFEED edgeConnector product family is a set of of modules allowing to connect to controllers of different vendors. The various dataFEED edgeConnector modules are packaged as Docker images. Each module consists of a webserver for configuration, a protocol driver to connect to a PLC and an OPC UA Server for data access.

It is possible to connect up to 20 SIMATIC S7-1200 or S7-1500 PLCs including optimized data blocks. The namespace configuration is done by browsing SIMATIC STEP 7 and TIA Portal variables.

Softing dataFEED edgeConnector Siemens is a containerized SIMATIC S7 connectivity module adding OPC UA Server functionality. After deployment, it is possible to configure Southbound and Northbound communication via local GUI or REST interface, in real scenarios.

==== Features

For southbound communication it is possible to connect up to 20 Siemens S7-300/400 or S7-1200/1500 PLCs including optimized data blocks. The Namespace configuration is done by importing the STEP7/TIA Projects or simply browsing the variables of the PLC.

The northbound communication runs with standardized OPC UA communication for data integration into management systems like ERP, MES or SCADA or for data exchange with other docker containers like Microsoft OPC Publisher for cloud scenarios.

The application supports security standards like SSL/TLS, X.509 certificates, authentication and data encryption. The container runs for 72h in demo mode. Fully activate the application via BYOL from Softing. This also requires the installation of the Softing floating license server (Windows application).
