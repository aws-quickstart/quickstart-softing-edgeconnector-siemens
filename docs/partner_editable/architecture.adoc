As shown in the architecture diagram, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A VPC with two Public Subnets, in two Availability Zones scaled by an Auto Scaling Group and data trafic routed by a Classic ELB Load Balancer
* A few AWS service instances like EC2 machine for the edge device, an ECS cluster/service/task definition needed to deploy the edgeConnector docker container to the EC2 machine
* An instance of the dataFEED edgeConnector Siemens edge software with its local web administration user interface as well as the S7 1200/1500 protocol simulator and data generator
* All AWS IoT SiteWise resources needed to start data flow from the edge software to AWS IoT Core and SiteWise: Asset Models, Assets (these are hard coded in the CloudFormation template for demo purposes), SiteWise Gateway configuration to access the OPC-UA server in the edgeConnector, Asset measurement mappings to UA tags in the server, a SiteWise Portal, Project and Dashboard to visualise the data (these latter ones can be skipped -- by default they are created)
