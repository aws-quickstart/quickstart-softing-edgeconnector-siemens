// There is only deployment option. If additional are required, add them here

This Quick Start provides one deployment option:

*Deploy {partner-product-name} into a new VPC (end-to-end deployment)*. This option builds a new VPC environment consisting of an Amazon EC2 instance, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, and other infrastructure components, an Amazon ECS cluster and task definition for deploying the Docker image in which {partner-product-name} runs.
