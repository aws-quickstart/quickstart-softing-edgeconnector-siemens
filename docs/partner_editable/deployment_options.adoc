// There is only deployment option. If additional are required, add them here

This Quick Start provides one deployment option:

* *Deploy {partner-product-name} into a new VPC (end-to-end deployment)*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-name} into this new VPC.
